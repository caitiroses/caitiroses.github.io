This course teaches basic skills used in the fields of engineering and technology. Students learn the engineering design process, the basics of sketching and technical drawings, and how to evaluate products. They also complete projects using the design process and learn to communicate their results effectively to others.</p></div></li>
                <li><div class="cte-program-list"><h3 id='a'>Engineering Design 1</h3><p id='b'>Engineering Design I is a second year course in the engineering CTE pathway, typically taken by sophomores. This course introduces students to various engineering disciplines and goes deeper into the design process. Students also learn about mechanisms, energy, thermodynamics, electrical systems, and control systems. The class is largely project-based and involves high levels of collaboration, as well as friendly competition.</p></div></li>
                <li><div class="cte-program-list"><h3 id='a'>Engineering Design 2</h3><p id='b'>Engineering Design II is a third year class in the engineering CTE pathway, typically taken by juniors. This course is designed to prepare students for postsecondary education in the fields of engineering and technology. Students learn about engineering ethics, control systems, fluid power systems, free body diagrams, and the use of standard engineering notebooks. Class activities include use of tools, economic analysis, solo and group projects, and presentation of design solutions.</p></div></li>
                <li><div class="cte-program-list"><h3 id='a'>Engineering Practicum</h3><p id='b'>Engineering Practicum is a fourth year capstone course in the engineering CTE pathway. The main focus of this course is the independent development of a product that interests each student using the engineering design process. The product is used to complete an engineering-focused Senior Thesis, which is a graduation requirement for the school.</p></div></li>

		Central Magnet School's Engineering CTE Program is a four year program designed to foster interest in engineering and 
		help students gain skills for postsecondary education in engineering and technology. The courses are largely project based, 
		with a focus on hands-on learning and collaboration. The program concludes with a capstone class focused on completing a
		senior thesis project.
		<br>
		<br>
		Central also offers a middle school engineering class. A variety of engineering clubs and opportunities are present at
		Central, including TSA, FIRST Robotics, ACE, and Society of Women Engineers.
